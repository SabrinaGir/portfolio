## Overview

Here is a portfolio I made to showcase skills I have learnt through both learning as a hobby and through my first semester in the Computer Science Technology program. It will be updated as I learn more and attempt to put certain ideas in place.

## Bugs / Challenges 

- I wasn't sure how to make the divs increase in size when you hover over them so I used this resource: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_zoom_hover.asp - SOLVED

- need to make my website responsive on mobile
    - make font size decrease at certain pixel size
    - or possibly use em / rem

- have a bug displaying the two projects side by side; will come back tomorrow to fix it. - SOLVED
    - just a small mistake, i was applying flex to the children instead of the parent

- having issues with the github logo in dark mode but that can be fixed later.
